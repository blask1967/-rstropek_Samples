# Change Request "Restart"

## Background

The current Minesweeper game simply ends when the user wins or loses. This is not ideal, as the user has to
reload the page to play again. This change request aims to add a restart button to the game, so the user can
restart the game without having to reload the page.

## UI

The restart button will appear after win/loose under the game status message.
