# Server-Sent-Events (SSE)

## Introduction

This repository contains a series of samples used to demonstrate Server-Sent-Events (SSE). The samples use TypeScript, Node.js, and Express on the server-side, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the client-side.

## Samples

1. [General discussion about long-running operations](./src/long-running.ts)
2. [Server-Sent-Events](./src/server-sent-events.ts) (fundamentals, more advanced concepts)
3. [Application of SSE in the OpenAI API](./src/openai.ts)
